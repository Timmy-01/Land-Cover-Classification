# Land-Cover-Classification
The project aims to investigate the potential advantages of using transfer learning and multiple instance learning to optimize land-cover classification. The existing methods for land-cover classification are thoroughly evaluated to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The proposed approach involves using a transfer learning framework that takes advantage of a pre-trained model on a large dataset to extract relevant features for land-cover classification.Multiple instance learning is utilized to tackle the inherent uncertainty in land-cover classification, where an image can contain more than one land-cover type.The post-processing techniques that is used to refine the land-cover classification results includes thresholding, morphological operations, and connected component analysis. The rationale behind each technique is explained, along with the code snippets used to implement them. Thus the executed model is analyzed to be efficient than the existing systems and the code and the output are successfully executed.
